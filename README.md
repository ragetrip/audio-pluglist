### Option A: Manual
1. Download the latest release assets (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) from this repository.
2. Create a folder inside your vault at:  
   `.obsidian/plugins/audio-pluglist/`
3. Copy the three files into that folder.
4. In Obsidian: **Settings → Community plugins → Installed plugins → Enable “Audio PlugList”.**

### Option B: BRAT (before it’s in the Community store)
If you use the **BRAT** plugin:
1. In BRAT, add this repo’s URL: https://github.com/ragetrip/audio-pluglist
2. Let BRAT install and enable the plugin.

**Settings → Community plugins → Browse**.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open **Settings → Audio PlugList**.
2. Under **Add New Playlist**, choose:
   - **From Folder** → pick a vault folder to index audio.
   - **From Link** → paste a direct URL.  
     *Note:* Please be aware that some services block external playback.
3. Click **Scan** on a playlist (or **Scan All**).
4. Open the view via **Ribbon button** (music icon) or the command **“Open Audio PlugList.”**
5. Use the **tab controls** or the **footer mini-player** to play, pause, skip, seek, adjust volume, toggle shuffle, and cycle repeat.

**Tips**  
- File names like `Artist - Title.mp3` or `Artist - Title.flac` are parsed into Artist/Title automatically.
- Turn on **Show Artist** / **Show Album** columns if you prefer richer lists.
- Enable **Fade out on Stop** and set a custom **Fade duration (ms)** if you like gentler stops.
- Footer mini-player will not directly control external link embeds, but will open the playlist to the working Tab view with controls.
